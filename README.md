Doodles app:

On the phone enjoy your self drawing doodles and adding them to your collection.
While drawing, the collection is continuously updated with the latest version of your doodle.
To recognize your doodle, you can enter a name and date and time are added.
Of course it is possible to remove a doodle from your collection.

This app is build using the React framework.
Data is stored in firebase in a JSON structure.
For styling I used Sass.
NPM is used for installing additional packages.
Gulp is used to build the project.
